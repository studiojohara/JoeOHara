	<h3>Graphic Designer. Illustrator. Web Developer</h3>

	<p>Joe is a graduate of Georgia State University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in drawing, painting and printmaking. Since graduating he has been working as a graphic designer/web developer in Atlanta and also a freelancing illustrator and painter.</p>

	<p>Joe loves of all things comics, he's been reading them since he could read and drawing them since he could hold a pencil, and is a huge fan of DC Comics. The toys which clutter up his many bookshelves are proof of that.</p>
